## Case Study: Data Governance Foundation for a STEM Pipeline

### How this case was informed

This case study draws from my experience as Vice President of Education & Programs at a regional aviation museum. I served in this role from 2017 to 2020. My responsibilities included student education strategy, program performance, and data governance across multi-year K–12 partnerships.

The data-governance and scaling challenges I encountered revealed patterns that recur across industries. These patterns emerge when organizations attempt to scale programs, analytics, or AI systems. Key achievements included managing growth from 30,000 to 45,000+ students annually. The portfolio secured $600K+ in grants. We achieved third-party certifications for outcomes and professional development practices.

I now provide project and program leadership through **Closing The Execution Gap: Bridging Knowledge, Implementation, and Trust**. I help organizations lead technology and innovation in traditional environments. The PM Risk Assessor agent translates lessons from scaling mission-critical programs. These lessons address governance, privacy, and audit constraints. The frameworks provide practical tools for senior PMs and program leaders navigating similar execution challenges.

## 1. Business Problem

The museum's mission was to broaden students' awareness and interest in STEM and aviation history. This happened through high-quality learning opportunities. The organization operated under museum-industry standards for legal compliance, ethical practice, and public accountability. 

When this work began in 2017, education programs reached just over 30,000 students per year. Programs included field trips, planetarium shows, outreach, and camps. The board set a goal of at least 5% annual growth.

Program scale was increasing, but data lived in silos. Surveys were created in online tools. They were exported to spreadsheets. Files were stored in shared folders with inconsistent labels. Partners interpreted data differently. 

There was no unified taxonomy across schools. Limited ability existed to see longitudinal impact across the "feeder pattern." This pattern spanned elementary through high school to college and workforce. Ownership and privacy controls around student and educator data were unclear. 

Leadership, board members, and funders lacked a governed, audit-ready view of outcomes. This created risk and limited confidence in expansion decisions.

## 2. Desired Future State and Success Criteria

The target state was a governed data foundation. It needed to reliably answer one question: "How are students moving along the STEM pipeline over time?" And: "Is this worth continued investment?" 

Success criteria included:

- Annual student reach growing beyond the baseline 5% per year. Clear reporting by school, grade, and program.
- Standardized, comparable outcome measures for knowledge, interest, confidence, and intent to pursue STEM.  
- A secure, repeatable data pipeline into an external outcomes platform. Dashboards for leadership, funders, and partners.
- Third-party validation that data-management and outcomes practices met external standards. This included professional development approval and outcomes/data-governance certification.

## 3. Stakeholders and End Users

- **Decision-makers**: Executive leadership and board. They were responsible for strategy, risk, and resource allocation.  
- **Key influencers**: School and public programs managers. School district and community partners. External evaluation vendor.
- **End users**:  
  - Students and educators experiencing aligned STEM programming.  
  - Funders, higher-education, and workforce partners. They used dashboards to gauge "day-one ready" talent and pipeline health.

## 4. Approach: Logic Model, Taxonomy, and Data Governance

### Logic model and taxonomy

The museum's logic model was operationalized across grade bands. Inputs included students, teachers, partners, and facilities. Activities included field trips, planetarium sessions, outreach, and camps. Outputs included exposures, touchpoints, and PD hours. Outcomes included STEM knowledge, interest, confidence, and career intent. 

Surveys were redesigned and standardized. Questions and response scales aligned to this model. This enabled comparable pre/post analysis by program, grade, and year.

### Data-governance framework

A lightweight but explicit data-governance framework was developed collaboratively:

- Ownership and responsibilities between the museum and school partners were clarified. This covered student and educator data. It included retention expectations and audit readiness.
- Educator professional development complied with state continuing education rules. This included ethics and applicability to certification areas. Seven-year record-keeping for attendance and hours aligned with CPE requirements.
- A secure data lifecycle was defined. Surveys were captured via online forms. Data was exported to structured spreadsheets. Information was cleaned and coded with shared taxonomies. Data was transmitted via password-protected collaboration tools. An external outcomes platform generated dashboards by grade, program, and year.

### Alignment with curriculum and industry standards

Programs were aligned with state curriculum and standards. Teacher guides and workshops were developed to reinforce classroom connections. 

The museum's governance practices followed museum-industry expectations. These were similar to American Alliance of Museums guidance. They covered legal compliance, ethical conduct, and stewardship of resources. Investment in staff development supported strategy execution.

## 5. Results, Data-Governance Validation, and Benefits

Within roughly two and a half years, annual student reach grew significantly. Growth moved from just over 30,000 to more than 40,000. Numbers approached 45,000–50,000. This consistently exceeded the original 5% growth target. The mix of programs and partnerships expanded. 

Progress indicators showed sustained growth, supported by standardized reporting. These indicators included students served, number of programs and guides used, educator PD participation, and partnerships.

Two forms of third-party validation confirmed the strength of the data-governance approach:

- **State professional development approval**: The organization became an approved continuing professional education (CPE) provider. This demonstrated that educator trainings met state rules. Qualified facilitators were used. Evaluations were collected. Audit-ready documentation for attendance and hours was maintained.
- **Outcomes/data-management certification**: A regional nonprofit evaluation body certified the organization's methodology. This covered collecting, analyzing, and reporting outcomes. It included making data-driven decisions, improving programs, and engaging stakeholders. This effectively functioned as an external review of the museum's data-governance system. It validated consistent instruments and taxonomies. It confirmed controlled access and transfer to the outcomes platform. It verified reliable dashboards for oversight.

Financially, the education portfolio secured more than $600K in grants during this period. Revenue goals were exceeded. A previously break-even signature program became revenue-generating while remaining mission-aligned. 

Collectively, these results strengthened the museum's position as a data-driven STEM hub. They offered funders and partners defensible evidence of impact along the STEM pipeline.

## 6. Lessons Informing the PM Risk Assessor Agent

This experience surfaced patterns that recur in any organization trying to scale analytics or AI:

- Growth without shared taxonomies and governed data flows quickly creates hidden risk. Metrics become fragile.  
- Feeder/pipeline patterns, data ownership, privacy constraints, and audit expectations must be designed up front. They cannot be retrofitted after dashboards or features ship.
- External validations are practical tests of data-governance maturity. These include certifications, audits, and outcomes reviews. They are not just badges.

**Drawing on both this foundational experience and ongoing work with organizations closing execution gaps**, the PM Risk Assessor agent translates these lessons. It provides structured checks and prompts for teams preparing to scale programs, dashboards, or agentic AI. 

The agent focuses on questions such as:

- Is there a clear business problem and pipeline/pattern defined?  
- Are taxonomies, instruments, and ownership standardized across partners and systems?  
- How is data privacy, legal, and governance being integrated from the start?  
- What external validation or audit readiness is in place before automation or agents are deployed?

By embedding these questions into an agentic workflow, the goal is clear. Help senior PMs and program leaders identify data-governance risks early. Build resilient foundations for future AI and analytics work.
