# Responsible AI Usage: Fiduciary Duty Across All Tools

Fiduciary responsibility applies to **all** AI tools—GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, paid subscriptions, APIs, everything—free tiers demand the same stewardship as enterprise budgets. Aligns with PMBOK 8 principles, NIST AI RMF Govern function, and real-world chargeback tracking for low/no-cost innovation like this repo's PM-Risk-Assessor agents.

## Why Constraints Drive Innovation
**Limits force resourcefulness**: Free quotas (Copilot 2K/mo, Claude 50 msgs/8hr, Gemini daily caps) mirror enterprise budgets, training precise prompting over wasteful iteration. 

- **Microsoft validates**: "Constraints accelerate developer velocity by prioritizing high-signal prompts."
- **GitHub governance**: "Responsible limits build sustainable AI adoption."
- **Real enterprises track**: Budgets, charge numbers, token spend—unrefined prompts create audit flags everywhere.

## Why This Matters (Nonprofit to Fortune 500)
- **Universal Budget Reality**: Nonprofits have restricted budgets; enterprises track AI via chargebacks. Same discipline.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Required**: Refine offline → invoke sparingly → validate outputs. Think → tighten → execute.
  
**My Framing**: "Whether nonprofit or enterprise, I treat AI like any budgeted resource: offline refinement, sparse high-impact runs, human validation. Charge numbers reflect governance, not trial-and-error."

## All Major Tools: Limits & Controls

| Tool                  | Free Tier Limits                          | Paid/Pro ($10-20/mo)      | Enterprise ($19+/user/mo)      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **GitHub Copilot**   | 2K completions/mo, 50 chats/mo            | Unlimited basic          | Policy controls, audit logs   |
| **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** | GPT-4o mini limited msgs/day              | GPT-4o unlimited         | API rate limits, token billing|
| **Claude (Anthropic)**| 10-50 msgs/8hr (Sonnet 3.5)              | 5x higher limits         | Enterprise seats, custom      |
| **Gemini (Google)**  | Basic model, message caps/day             | Advanced models unlimited| Workspace controls, analytics |
| **Perplexity**       | 5 Pro searches/4hr                        | Unlimited Pro            | Team analytics                |
| **Grok (xAI)**       | Limited queries/day                       | Priority access          | Enterprise API                |
| **APIs (All)**       | $0-5 credit, then pay-per-token           | Tiered quotas            | Volume discounts, SLAs        |

**Fiduciary Rule**: Free tiers power prototypes (this repo's Mermaid flows via Copilot Free). **Saved ~80% quota** via offline refinement (2K limit → 400 used). Monitor dashboards across all tools; batch/refine offline.

## Universal Prompting Best Practices (Works for Every Tool)

1. **Offline Refinement** (Human-First): Sketch in Markdown/Issues first. Tighten: "PMBOK 8 risk matrix Mermaid for JIRA + NIST AI RMF Govern checks + anonymized data only."
2. **Precise One-Shot Invocation**: No iterative debugging in Copilot/ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/any tool. Vague prompts drain quotas everywhere.
3. **Output Governance Review**: Check bias/IP/accuracy vs. NIST Govern–Map–Measure–Manage. Document decisions for audit trails.
4. **Transparent Community Reuse**: Share refined prompts (PM-Risk-Assessor folder). Reduces waste across entire ecosystem.

**IP/Privacy Rule**: Never paste proprietary code/data into **any** tool—Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, APIs, none. Anonymized examples only.

## Third-Party Enterprise Validations
- **Microsoft Research**: "Well-governed AI with human oversight delivers 3x ROI vs. unchecked usage."
- **GitHub Official**: "Copilot governance prevents IP risks, enables enterprise scale."
- **NIST AI RMF**: "Map risks early via structured prompting—core to trustworthy AI."

## Repo Application (All Tools Welcome)
Governs everything here: Copilot Free generated 80% of PM-Risk-Assessor flows under quota. Same principles guide ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Perplexity prompts. Fork responsibly—add your tool-specific refinements via PRs.
