# Innovation In Action

This repository captures how I translate cross-industry project, program, and portfolio leadership experience into practical innovation work. It is a living record of how I build, test, and evolve new capabilities — especially where technology, operating environments, and human systems intersect.

My focus is not on experimenting with tools for their own sake, but on designing approaches that can survive real organizational constraints: governance, risk, resource limits, stakeholder dynamics, and the need to prove value.

## Innovation in Action

This repository captures the practical steps I take to turn emerging technologies into real operational capability across project, program, and portfolio environments.

**Q1 2026 — Built a Microsoft Foundry AI agent prototype that encodes my Cross-Industry PM AI Fluency framework, designed for controlled testing, enterprise governance, and future scale.**

## How I Approach Building AI Agents and AI Practices

I treat AI agent development as an organizational design problem first, and a tooling exercise second. My approach focuses on building systems that can survive real operating environments, not just demos.

- Start with the current-state environment: where data lives, how it’s structured or unstructured, and which systems teams already use.
- Map how work actually flows across teams and tools before introducing any AI.
- Define the business problem and feasible use cases first, not the model.
- Bring governance, risk, and compliance requirements in at the beginning, not after building.
- Structure knowledge and taxonomies offline so AI behavior is reliable and reproducible.
- Design agent instructions, prompt logic, and evaluation criteria outside the tool to avoid trial-and-error building.
- Build and test iteratively using traces to identify failure modes.
- Add human-in-the-loop controls where judgment and accountability are required.
- Document lessons learned and define scaling requirements across cost, people, and governance.

The goal is simple: build AI systems that fit how organizations actually work, not how demos pretend they work.
