**From frameworks to working agents: Operationalizing cross-industry PM insights through agentic workflows.**

This repository bridges strategic PM knowledge and practical implementation. It demonstrates how lessons from scaling mission-critical programs translate into AI agents that help organizations close execution gaps.

## Why Agentic Workflows?

AI tools can automate repetitive tasks. That's useful but limited. 

Agentic workflows do something different. They embed judgment, context, and structured decision-making into systems that adapt and respond. For traditional organizations navigating transformation, this distinction matters.

**Task automation** handles known processes: scheduling meetings, generating reports, routing approvals.

**Agentic systems** handle ambiguity: evaluating risks across competing priorities, surfacing governance gaps before they become crises, mapping stakeholder influence when roles and relationships shift.

The PM Risk Assessor and future agents in this repository demonstrate this evolution. They don't just execute checklists. They ask the right questions at the right time, informed by patterns from real-world scaling challenges.

## 🤖 Agent-First vs API-First: When to Choose

Built low-code first (free Copilot tier, no APIs). Here's why it works for PMs:

**✅ Choose Agent-First When:**
- Need MVP in hours (risk prototypes)
- Resource-constrained teams  
- Prove fluency fast (interviews, pilots)
- Domain-specific scenarios (PMBOK risk)

**🔄 Add APIs Later For:**
- Enterprise scaling (CRM hooks)
- Multi-tool orchestration
- Production RBAC/compliance

*90% PM use cases start here. Scale as needed.*

## 🛠️ Active Development
### **PM Risk Assessor** `/agents/pm-risk-assessor` (Dec 2025)
Prompt library available now. Identifies governance and execution risks before teams scale analytics or AI systems.  
**[Use the Prompts →](agents/pm-risk-assessor/prompts/)** | **[Agent Overview](agents/pm-risk-assessor/README.md)** | **[Case Study](agents/pm-risk-assessor/case-vp-stem-data-foundation.md)** | **[See Example](agents/pm-risk-assessor/examples/sample-assessment-stem-museum.md)**

*Status: Prompt Library Available (5 prompts + sample assessment) | Full Agent Q1 2026

## Suggested Artifacts 
Enhance PM Risk Assessor in your workflows:
- **JIRA**: Import prompts as Kanban issues (risk register board)
- **Confluence**: Embed agent outputs + NIST mappings
- **Power BI**: Risk heatmap from CSV exports
- **GitHub Issues**: Log gaps/customizations (template ready)

Fork & contribute via Issues.


## NIST AI RMF–Aligned
Recently completed the LinkedIn Learning course **Understanding and Implementing the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)**. I am using its core functions to shape how these agents are structured, evaluated, and governed. As the PM Risk Assessor evolves from secure, anonymous prompt flows into full agents, it will increasingly reference the NIST AI RMF Playbook and NIST Cybersecurity Framework to anchor risk, governance, and monitoring activities across the AI lifecycle.

## 🔮 Planned Agents (2026)

### **Change Readiness Diagnostic** `/agents/change-readiness` (Q1 2026)
Scores organizational maturity against transformation frameworks. Identifies capability gaps before major initiatives.

### **Stakeholder Alignment Tool** `/agents/stakeholder-align` (Q1 2026)  
Maps influence patterns and communication strategies. Surfaces misalignment early in cross-functional programs.

## 📚 Foundation: Real Execution Experience

These agents are informed by cross-industry program leadership spanning manufacturing, education, and nonprofit sectors:

* **[Raytheon Factory Rearrangement](raytheon-factory-rearrangement)** – $3.2M saved, 30+ capital projects coordinated across operations
* **[STEM Museum Data Governance](agents/pm-risk-assessor/case-vp-stem-data-foundation.md)** – Scaled from 30K to 45K+ students with governance certifications
* **[InnovationNet Nonprofit Platform](innovationnet-nonprofit-leadership)** – 10+ programs across 4 organizations
* **[Strategic Leadership Consulting](strategic-leadership-and-innovation)** – Agile/PMP implementation in traditional sectors

The patterns from these experiences—taxonomy failures, governance gaps, stakeholder misalignment, audit readiness—recur across industries. The agents translate those patterns into practical tools.
