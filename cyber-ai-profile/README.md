# Cyber AI Profile (NIST IR 8596) [page:0]

NIST's draft Cybersecurity Framework Profile for AI converges CSF 2.0, AI RMF, and RMF into actionable outcomes for securing AI systems. Open for comments until Jan 30, 2026: [PDF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2025/NIST.IR.8596.iprd.pdf) [page:0]

## Framework Convergence
| Framework | Focus | Profile Role |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| CSF 2.0 | Cyber Resilience | Taxonomy: Govern-Recover [page:0] |
| AI RMF 1.0 | Trustworthiness | AI Risks: Bias, Validity [page:0] |
| Cyber AI Profile | AI-Cyber Intersection | Maps to CSF Subcategories [page:0] |

## Three Pillars
### Secure (AI Systems)
Protect pipelines from poisoning/injection. Prompt: "Map adversarial robustness risks in PM AI agent." [page:0]

### Defend (AI-Enabled)
Counter automation bias in SOCs. Ties to your PM Risk Assessor demo. [page:0][memory:30]

### Thwart (AI Attacks)
Update IAM for deepfakes/agentic recon. [page:0]

## GRC Mapping
- **No Guesswork**: CSF subcats like AI Asset Mgmt (ID.AM).
- **Supply Chain**: AI SBOMs for vendors. [page:0]

**Next**: Forkable prompts in `/prompts/` for RMF audits.
