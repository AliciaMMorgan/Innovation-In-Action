# Cyber AI Profile (NIST IR 8596) 

NIST's draft Cybersecurity Framework Profile for AI converges CSF 2.0, AI RMF, and RMF into actionable outcomes for securing AI systems. Open for comments until Jan 30, 2026: [PDF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2025/NIST.IR.8596.iprd.pdf) 

## Framework Convergence
| Framework | Focus | Profile Role |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| CSF 2.0 | Cyber Resilience | Taxonomy: Govern-Recover|
| AI RMF 1.0 | Trustworthiness | 
AI Risks: Bias, Validity |
| Cyber AI Profile | AI-Cyber Intersection | Maps to CSF Subcategories |

## Three Pillars
### Secure (AI Systems)
Protect pipelines from poisoning/injection. Prompt: "Map adversarial robustness risks in PM AI agent." 

### Defend (AI-Enabled)
Counter automation bias in SOCs. Ties to your PM Risk Assessor demo. 

### Thwart (AI Attacks)
Update IAM for deepfakes/agentic recon.

## GRC Mapping
- **No Guesswork**: CSF subcats like AI Asset Mgmt (ID.AM).
- **Supply Chain**: AI SBOMs for vendors. 

**Next**: Forkable prompts in `/prompts/` for RMF audits.
